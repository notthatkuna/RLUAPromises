## Change group 1:

* Created initial files

## Change group 2:

* Added ``._then_`` function to ``Promise`` to make after-resolve functions easier to write
* Fixed a mistake I made when creating the two events: I created the events in studio rather than programatically, which is now fixed


# 8/29/21

## Change group 1:

* Added a discontinue function to the main Promise object which rejects all alive promises and stops promises from being made or appended to the table.
